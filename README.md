# COGS118B_finalProject

This is the group repo for Team Ten's final project for COGS118B.
In this project, we have used the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) which contains information about the gender, age, height, weight, country, and year of Olympic athletes. This includes all Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 and, as the author of the dataset states, was scraped from [here](http://www.sports-reference.com/).

We aim to test the effectiveness of online and offline K-means algorithms by grouping this data across different time periods and seeing if the resulting cluster assignments differ with the introduction of more data or if there is a noticable difference between the clustering of online versus offline K-means algorithms.
